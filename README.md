[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/evert/sabre-vobject.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/evert/sabre-vobject)

The VObject library allows you to easily parse and manipulate iCalendar and vCard objects using PHP.
The goal of the VObject library is to create a very complete library, with an easy to use API.
